# Research-Paper--Gastrointestinal-Tract-Classification
This repository features a modified CNN for automated gastrointestinal (GI) disease classification using the KVASIR dataset. It compares models like Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and CNN, with the modified CNN achieving 75% accuracy. Includes preprocessing, model architectures, and performance analyses for a robust GI disease detection framework.
