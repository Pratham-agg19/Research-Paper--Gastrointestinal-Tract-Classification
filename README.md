# Research-Paper--Gastrointestinal-Tract-Classification
This repository contains analysis of a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the automated classification of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases using the KVASIR dataset. The study evaluates multiple machine learning and deep learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and CNNs, for multi-class image classification. The modified CNN demonstrated superior performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 75%, highlighting its potential for improving diagnostic precision in clinical workflows. The repository includes data preprocessing techniques, model architectures, and performance comparisons to provide a robust framework for GI disease detection.
